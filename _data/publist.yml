- title: "Dynamically Tagged Groups of Very Metal-poor Halo Stars from the HK and Hamburg/ESO Surveys"
  image: main_grupinhos.png
  description: Analyzing dynamical properties of very metal-poor halo stars we were able to identify Dynamically Tagged Groups (DTGs) via clustering algorithm, associating with previously known prominent substructures as well new DTGs that can help unveil the history of formation of our Galaxy.

  description: We present the results of spectroscopic follow-up for 1897 low-metallicity star candidates, selected from the Best & Brightest (B&B) Survey, carried out with the GMOS-N/S (Gemini North/South telescopes) and Goodman (SOAR Telescope) spectrographs.

  image: letter_gui.jpeg
  description:  We identify new members of the Helmi stream in the combined Gaia eDR3 + GALAH DR3 and demonstrate that their chemical composition is similar to dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, providing evidence that his substructure is the debris of a system of similar kind.

- title: "The Chemodynamical Nature of the Triangulum-Andromeda Overdensity"
  image: paper_yuri.png
  description:  In this work, we carried out a chemodynamical investigation of the largest homogenous sample of Triangulum-Andromeda Overdensity (TriAnd) member stars currently available. We conclude that the genuine TriAnd stars have kinematics and chemistry consistent with the Milky Way’s outer disk, while the presence of some halo (accreted) interlopers explain the historical dispute regarding this overdensity’s true origin.
